### Problem Statement
With the current global pandemic situation, its very likely that people are worried always, they try getting information from all reliable sources and most importantly are perturbed who to reach out of in case of medical help. This very thought drove us to use our skills gained during the course and make a user friendly web application that not only provides right information about COVID-19 but also helps them reach out to right kind of hospital that can provide them all the facilities they need to recover. Our aim through this application is to provide right kind of resource allocation for the ones in need, educate people with the right facts and figures and make this application as user friendly as possible.
